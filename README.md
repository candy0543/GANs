Generating Images of Aircraft Pressure Refuelling Scenes in Various Weather Conditions Using Image Style Transfer

This project presents an unsupervised, unified multi-domain image-to-image translation framework designed for ground refuelling image weather domain translation. The goal is to generate realistic variations of refuelling scenes under different weather conditions, which can be valuable for simulation, training, and safety analysis in aerospace applications.

Our approach builds upon existing efficient methods and introduces several key innovations:

A custom training and testing pipeline optimised for weather domain shifts.

Contrastive learning enhancements tailored for image synthesis tasks.

Integration of multiple loss functions and feature extraction strategies to boost realism and detail preservation.

Key Achievements:

Improved image quality across multiple weather domains.

Reduced training time without sacrificing output fidelity.

Unified framework adaptable to other domain translation tasks beyond aerospace.
